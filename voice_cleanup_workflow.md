# Voice Cleanup Workflow

This document outlines my typical approach to preparing spoken-word audio for delivery.

## 1. Session prep
- Check sample rate and bit depth
- Organize tracks and naming
- Remove obvious clipping or distortion issues

## 2. Cleanup
- Manual removal of mouth clicks and excessive breaths
- Noise reduction only when necessary
- Light EQ to improve intelligibility
- Gentle compression for consistency

## 3. Consistency & delivery
- Match tone and loudness across takes
- Avoid over-processing to preserve natural timbre
- Export according to client or platform specs
